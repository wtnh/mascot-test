		<div>Motor cars in the 1920’s and 30’s sported radiator caps with a bolt fitting designed to serve as a mount for a “mascot” – a symbol of the owner’s individuality.  Renowned artist René Lalique (1860 – 1945) seized upon the opportunity to create beautiful mascots in glass.  This example is fitted onto a special base allowing it to be wired in such a way that a multicolored filter illuminated the falcon in colors of red, blue, green, amber or mauve; creating a stunning effect at night.  Lalique mascots demanded a high price – perfect for the discriminating automobile owner who wished to distinguish his car from others making it uniquely his own.

		<div>This very unusual mascot depicts the head of a jester (possibly the popular character Punch) 
perched atop a globe.  All of the continents and oceans  are correctly imprinted on the globe, and it is stamped with the words “Always on Top”. The globe is mounted on an inverted radiatorcap attached to the upper part of a small piston.</div>

		<div>PREVIOUS</div>
		<div>The Bentley insignia was first introduced by brothers W.O. and H.M. Bentley in 1920. After the Rolls-Royce take-over of Bentley in 1931, Charles Sykes, the creator of the iconic Spirit of Ecstasy mascot, submitted a number of designs including this one. Subsequently, in 1935, Bentley held a competition for a new design, offering a prize of ₤50 to the winner.  At the end of the competition, Bentley decreed that “nothing sufficiently outstanding was entered”, so instead of adopting a new design, two consolation prizes of ₤25 each were awarded.  Flying B mascots that retract into the grille of todays Bentley bonnets are still available as a distinctive accessory.</div>

		<div>SELECT A MASCOT</div>
		<div>This rare Francois Bazin design was issued as a factory option (costing only $37.50) for those lucky enough to purchase the extraordinary Duesenberg.  Pegasus was also available for purchase through mail order catalogues such as Nil Melior and Tanquary.  According to the Tanquary Catalogue, “Pegasus was the winged horse of the Gods of Mt. Olympus.  Born of the Sea foam and the blood of Medusa.”</div>
